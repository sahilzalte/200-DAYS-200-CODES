        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>
            CSS, or <span class="highlight">Cascading Style Sheets</span>, is a stylesheet language used for describing
            the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.
        </p>

        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>
            The idea of separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS) originated in the early 1990s. Here are some
            key milestones:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1994:</strong> CSS was proposed by <span class="highlight">HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>1996:</strong> The first CSS specification, <em>CSS1</em>, was published by the W3C.</li>
            <li><strong>1998:</strong> CSS2 was introduced, adding support for media types and positioning.</li>
            <li><strong>2011:</strong> CSS3 was modularized, allowing for more targeted updates and features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why CSS Matters</h2>
        <p>
            CSS enhances the user experience by making web pages more visually appealing and ensuring they are
            accessible across devices. It is a cornerstone technology alongside HTML and JavaScript in web development.
